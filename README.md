# Simple-Calculator
A simple program for calculating two values in Pyhton
I am submitting this project to learn from others about how I write in Python thus far. I am learning and want to know if there are any ways I could shorten any lines. I also want to learn how to integrate this somewhere to visualize an actual calculator and use this code to run it. Your feedback is emensly valuable to me!
